# One Playthrough

**4.2.0 · keogh · Borderlands GOTY Enhanced**

Play from level **1 to 69** in one continuous journey through Pandora. Enemies
and mission offers scale with you across the main story and all four DLCs,
without restarting the story in another playthrough.

Higher-level areas and missions keep their vanilla minimums. Once you outlevel
them, they scale with you—including every DLC, without first completing it.
Available missions follow your level until accepted; accepted missions keep
their level. Equipment rewards match that accepted mission level, even if
you finish earlier or later; SDU upgrades keep their native behaviour.

Ordinary enemies retain native variety, with **85% native**, **8% at least +1 level**,
**6% at least +2**, and **1% at least +3**, above your level or the area's minimum, whichever is higher.
Naturally stronger enemies keep their strength; bonuses do not stack. Named
enemies and bosses retain native scaling, with a player-level floor and no rare
bonus. World loot and money use the game's normal rules. Designed for solo play;
reaching level 69 depends on how much you play.

## Install and play

1. Install the [BL1 PythonSDK mod manager](https://bl-sdk.github.io/willow1-mod-db/).
2. Close the game. Copy [OnePlaythrough.sdkmod](dist/OnePlaythrough.sdkmod) into
   the game's `sdk_mods` folder.
3. Launch the game and enable **One Playthrough** in **Mods**. Disable other
   enemy or mission scaling mods.
4. Choose **New Game**, create your character and enjoy the full introduction.
5. Play normally. Next time, choose **Continue** with the mod enabled. Stay in
   the first playthrough to finish remaining missions and DLCs after the story.

**Upgrading from Playthrough 3 v4?** Remove its old SDK archive or unpacked mod
folder before installing this one. Choose **Continue** with your existing
character; saved mission levels transfer automatically.

For troubleshooting, **F10** exports a report to
`sdk_mods/settings/OnePlaythrough/diagnostics/`.
